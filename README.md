# Aptly Quotes
Consider this:
```
You're looking for the perfect quote for a gift card, a writing assignment or a social media post,
but it takes too much time and effort to Google for a suitable quote.
```

## Overview
This product was created in five hours for Startup Weekend Silicon Valley. In the context of social innovation, we have also added a linter for cyberbullying.

## Solution
We have created an in-house improved search engine for finding apt quotes using react. It allows people to filter more specifically for their needs and preferences.

For example:<br>
"birthday elegant" - Returns a list of quotes for your mother that is elegant<br>
"birthday funny" - Returns a list of quotes for your mother that is humourous
"love music"
"love women"

## Team
This project was built by an interesting team of myself, Vasooda, Eduardo and Pablo!
