# Aptly Quotes 
### Consider this:
```
You're looking for the perfect quote for a gift card, a writing assignment or a social media post,
but it takes too much time and effort to Google for a suitable quote.
```

## Overview
This product was created in five hours for Startup Weekend Silicon Valley.<br>
In the context of social innovation, we added a **linter for cyberbullying**.

## Solution
Using ReactJS, we created an improved search engine for finding apt quotes. It allows people to filter specifically for their needs and preferences.

Also, we do **sentiment analysis** to check for crude language and create flags to alert users.

## Usage
- `cd front-end`
- Run `npm start`
- Use a web browser to access localhost:3000.
- To test cyberbullying linter, type `I hate you` and wait for two seconds. Try `I dislike you` and see that nothing appears.
- To test quote search, type two parameters, such as:
```
motivational startup
motivational depressed
love women
love music
true love
birthday elegant
birthday funny
```

## Team
This project was built by an interesting team of myself, Vasooda, Eduardo and Pablo!
